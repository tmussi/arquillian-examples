# Arquillian Examples

This repository hosts the example projects that are covered in the [Arquillian Guides](http://arquillian.org/guides/). These projects can be identified by the word "tutorial" in the name. There are several additional examples that demonstrate other functionality in Arquillian. All the projects in this repository are self-contained (they do not use parent projects).

To see an even more comprehensive set of example tests, browse the [Arquillian Showcase](https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-showcase) repository.
